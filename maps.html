	<div id = "flood"> 
		<h2>Flood Plain</h2>
		<p>
			The largest flooding areas are located along the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia Watershed west of the city boundary, from the southernmost point of Hyattsville to University Hills Duck Pond Park up north. The most critical locations of flooding include Magruder Park (1), nearby West Hyattsville Metro Station areas (2), and University Hills Duck Pond Park (3).

	<div id = "watershed"> 
		<h2>Watershed</h2>
		<p>
			A ridge, represented in teal blue in this map, runs directly in the middle of Hyattsville: this boundary splits the Anacostia River into Northwest and Northeast branches. This means that Hyattsville occupies simultaneously two watersheds.

	<div id = "soil"> 
		<h2>Soil Type</h2>
		<p>
			It is evident that Hyattsville has a diverse range of soil types; however, the most important ones here include flood-prone soils. These flood-prone soils are highlighted in blue. Many flood regions lie along the edge of the city limits by bodies of water such as the Northeast and Northwest Branches of the Anacostia River and University Hills Pond Park. Other flood regions are situated along areas where there is a high amount of impervious surfaces (The Mall at Prince George’s, Northwestern High School, residential areas).

	<div id = "treecanopy"> 
		<h2>Tree Canopy</h2>
		<p>
			Tree Canopy helps the watershed in few ways such as slowing down rainfall. This prevents water from 
			running off paved surfaces which picks up pollutants along the way. This in turn also increase water quality. 
			Some other benefits include increasing air quality and lowering air temperatures.<br>
			The largest portions of tree canopy cover include Magruder Park (1), southeastern areas along the Northwest Branch of the Anacostia River, and large northern areas of Hyattsville, including University Hills Duck Pond (2). There is sparse tree canopy cover in residential areas; the least amount of tree canopy cover is found along densely pavemented areas such as  Northwestern High School (3), West Hyattsville Metro Station (4), The Mall at Prince George’s (5), area surrounding Baltimore Ave (6).

	<div id = "slope"> 
		<h2>Slope</h2>
		<p>
			Water and rainfall flows down the slopes. The greater the slope, the faster the water would flow which aids 
			in fast flood. Based on the slope map below, there is a great amount of slope northwest part of Hyattsville. 
			Another steady part of slope runs down southwest to southeast part of Hyattsville. From the flood maps, these 
			areas have some chance of flooding.<br>
      The light pink color represents between 15% and 25% slope; the dark red – greater than 25% slope. Hyattsville has numerous areas where slope exceeds 25%, especially the residential areas in the heart of the city, along roads, and around The Mall at Prince George’s (1).

	<div id = "surface"> 
		<h2>Impervious Surface</h2>
		<p>
			Impervious surfaces of Hyattsville. The city is approximately outlined in red. The largest concentrations of impervious surfaces include mostly pavemented areas - The Mall at Prince George’s (1), Northwestern High School (2), Route 1 area and the surrounding neighborhoods and businesses (3), West Hyattsville residential areas and metro station (4).
